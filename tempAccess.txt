My final project will be a modular Dapp/add-on to uport which enables people to temporarily share access with others. The idea is that if Alice has access to a certain database via her uPort, and Bob wants access, Bob can pay Alice some fee in exchange for temporarily being added to a uport “whitelist” such that he can log in and use the database using his own uport for a predetermined amount of time. The current model would have Alice give Bob full access and then manually change the password or take some other measure to reinstate security. This would allow Alice to simply give limited access to Bob (Bob shouldn’t be able to give access to the dataset to anyone else) for a given amount of time without being able to trust that Bob would abuse the access. Additionally, Bob now knows exactly how much time he will have and can weigh the price accordingly. Both parties have greater information than they would have in the current system. The advantage to this over a centralized system is that there is no single point of failure. For time-sensitive case like temporary access, the possibility of a DOS attack make the prospect of purchasing access much less attractive – why would I want to pay for access which is not necessarily guaranteed?
